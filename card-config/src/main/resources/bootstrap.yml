#Note! To be able to resolve http://discovery, an antry in /etc/hosts is needed
#Note! Move this shit over to git repo if possible
#Note! Check out the eureka.instance.preferIpAddress=true to advertize IPs instead of hostnames (to amke it work in docker)

      #The first two can be used to run against eureka when card-config is run with java -jar

      #This one is needed when card-config is run inside docker, since DNS names are hard to translate between containers.
